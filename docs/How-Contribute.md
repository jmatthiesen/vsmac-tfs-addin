# How to Contribute

Follow the style used by the [.NET Foundation](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md), with two primary exceptions:

- We do not use the private keyword as it is the default accessibility level in C#.
- We use hard tabs over spaces. You can change this setting in VS 2015 via Tools > Options and navigating to Text Editor > C# and selecting the "Keep tabs" radio option.
